# Execel VBA stock market report

I'm here to showcase the stock values using excel VBA.
The Spreadsheet contains multiple stocks and the goal is to find the yearly change per stock.
The percent change per stock and the total amount of stock purchased.

From the results obtained we then find the stock that has the greatest percentage and the smallest percentage change.
Also presented was most purchased stock.
